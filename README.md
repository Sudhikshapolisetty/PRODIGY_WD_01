# Responsive Landing Page 🌐

This project was developed as part of my virtual internship with PRODIGY-INFOTECH. It’s a fully responsive landing page that features a sticky navbar with dynamic color transitions, changing upon scroll and hover interactions.

## Features 📋

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Sticky Navbar**: Stays fixed at the top of the page while scrolling.
- **Color Transitions**: Navbar color changes on scroll, with hover effects on navigation options for enhanced interactivity.

## Technologies Used 💻

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript for scroll and hover effects
- Any additional libraries, if used

## How to View the Page 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sudhikshapolisetty/responsive-landing-page.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to explore the landing page.

## Future Enhancements 🔧

- Adding a theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- Additional animations for smooth user experience
